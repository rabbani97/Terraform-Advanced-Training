Instead of using a local state file, you are going to use a storage container to store your state file.
Steps:

Create a storage account with a blob container:

You can perform this step manually in the Azure portal.
Alternatively, you can use the Azure CLI to create the storage account and blob container.


Configure Terraform to use the storage account for state management:

Add the backend configuration in your Terraform configuration file to ensure that your state file will be stored in the storage account you created.
Use the following Terraform commands to initialize and apply this configuration:terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply


Confirm that the configuration works by checking that the state file is stored in the blob container.


Add a key vault to your Terraform configuration:

Update your Terraform configuration to include a key vault.
Ensure to add the necessary role assignments to get the right permissions for adding a secret to your key vault. For example, assign the 'Key vault secrets user' role.


Generate a secret with a random provider and add it to your key vault:

Use the random provider in Terraform to generate a secret.
Add the generated secret to the key vault as a secret.


Validate the state file:

Check your state file to confirm that the secret is displayed there.



By following these steps, you will be able to use a storage container to store your Terraform state file instead of a local state file and manage secrets securely using Azure Key Vault.
