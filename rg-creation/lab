The image provides a detailed lab exercise that builds upon a previously created module for storage accounts in Terraform. The exercise introduces advanced concepts to enhance the module. Here are the steps to follow:
Lab Steps and Tasks

Input Validation:

Task: Add input validation for the storage account name variable.
Requirements: The storage account name must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and consist of only lowercase letters and numbers.
Action: Test the deployment with both a name that doesn't meet the requirements and with one that does to ensure the validation works properly.


Outputs:

Task: Add outputs to your storage account module.
Outputs to Add:
Storage account ID.
Storage account name.


Purpose: Expose these values from the module so that they can be used in other configurations or modules.


Using the count Argument:

Task: Use the count argument to deploy two storage accounts instead of invoking the module twice.
Action: Test your code by deploying the storage accounts to ensure both are created as expected.


Using for_each Instead of count:

Scenario: Instead of using the count index in the storage account name, you want one storage account with the suffix one and the other with two.
Task: Change your code to use the for_each argument and a variable for the storage account names.
Action: Deploy your solution to see if it works, ensuring each storage account is correctly named.


Deploy to Multiple Environments:

Task: Deploy the solution to two separate resource groups: one for dev and one for prod.
Steps:
Create a variable to represent these environments.
Add a .tfvars file for both environments to specify the variable values.
Update the resource group name and storage account names to include the environment.


Action: Deploy your solution to ensure it creates resources in both environments correctly.


Conditional Resource Creation:

Task: Add a resource of type azurerm_storage_container to your configuration to deploy a container.
Condition: Only deploy this resource when the environment is prod.
Action: Implement the conditional logic and test the deployment in both dev and prod environments to verify the container is only created in prod.



Summary
This lab exercise is designed to deepen your understanding and proficiency with Terraform modules, particularly focusing on:

Input validation.
Output management.
Use of count and for_each arguments for dynamic resource creation.
Deployment across multiple environments.
Conditional resource creation based on environment.

It comprehensively guides you through enhancing a module with best practices and advanced Terraform concepts, ensuring you can create scalable, reusable, and maintainable infrastructure as code.
